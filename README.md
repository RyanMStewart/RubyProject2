# TellMe - Ruby

This is a continuation of what QuoteThis is capable of; specifically, iterating through an array of stock symbols at set time intervals to download price information and send off SMS messages with said information.

The symbols, for now, must be set manually in the code, as well as the times you'd like the stocks to be 'looked-up.'
One could easily add more time intervals throughout the day if necessary.
